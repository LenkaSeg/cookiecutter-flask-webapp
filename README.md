# CookieCutter for Fedora Infrastructure webapps

This is a [CookieCutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io) template directory for
Fedora Infrastructure webapps that are based on Flask.

Use it with:
```
cookiecutter gh:fedora-infra/cookiecutter-flask-webapp
```

It will ask you for the application name and some other variables, and will create the package
structure for you.
